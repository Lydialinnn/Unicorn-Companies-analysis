# Unicorn Company analysis
Unicorn companies is a term commonly used in venture capital to describe privately held startups whose valuation exceeds one billion. In this project, I use a public dataset from Maven Analytics Website ([click here](https://www.mavenanalytics.io)) and conduct analysis with SQL and Tableau.

## Data cleaning and preparation with MySQL
Here is the [MySQL code](https://github.com/Lydialinnn/Unicorn-Companies-analysis/blob/main/data%20cleaning.sql)

## Data Visualization in Tableau
Some of the questions that inspired the visualization were:

- Where did these Unicorns distributed across the world? <br>
- What are the trend Unicron over years? <br>
- Which industries attracted investors' interests in terms of initial fund raised? <br>
- Who are the biggest investors? <br>
